### What I learned

This portfolio was a project I started back when I first started coding, I've updated it since, BUT, I can honestly say I learned so much from the time I started coding it to when I was finished, I ran into mobile problems which after a time reading up how it works and putting it into practice, I finally had gotten it to work properly!
